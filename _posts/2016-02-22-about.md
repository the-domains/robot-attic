We have an inspiration, devote time to a project and work hard at 
something in its season. Then we get stuck, run out of time, lose 
interest or just feel it has never reached the level of perfection for 
it to see the light of day. So we box it up and stuff it in the attic.

Good ideas languish hidden upstairs, and we are impoverished by their
neglect. Even an unfinished idea has worth. It's a disservice to 
ourselves and others when we have thought deeply about a subject or 
created something nifty but never manifest any part of that effort 
publicly (or at least to an audience greater than one). Important parts 
of ourselves remain invisible to others. They must make somewhat 
arbitrary estimations of our capabilities or knowledge or existence when
sizing us up. "\[Our\] worth's unknown, although \[our\] height be taken."
